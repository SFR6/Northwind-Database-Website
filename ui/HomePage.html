    <p>This web application is designed to access and manipulate some tables from the NorthWind database.</p>
    <p>Any user can perform read operations on the 'Product' and 'Category' tables.</p>
    <p>If you are an employee, you can log in by using the "Employee Account" tab and the "Log In" subtab. Depending on the account's user type, you can perform some or all "CRUD" operations on the 'Employee', 'Customer', 'Supplier', 'Shipper', 'Territory', 'Product' and 'Order' tables.</p>
    <p>Additionally, every employee, once logged in and regardless of their user type, will be able to see the list of all employees, their own territories and their own orders.</p>
